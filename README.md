Learning Log - an online journal system that lets you 
keep track of information you’ve learned about
particular topics.

This web app allows users to log the topics they’re 
interested in and to make journal entries as they learn 
about each topic. The Learning Log home page should describe
the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
